# employee-gen

You can create an html doc with a list of employees, their roles, and contact
information.

## Description

You are prompted through the terminal if they want to create a new
employee card. You can specify whether the employee is a manager,
engineer, or intern. Each employee instance will have prompts
for the user to fill in. Once the prompts are finished you will be
redirected back to the beginning of the program, where you can cycle
through again or exit. Each employee will be added as html to the
prod file, where you can access a web app that displays all employees
as cards.

## Installation
Make sure to install the package.json and run the app through the terminal.
You can access the html output in the prod folder.
